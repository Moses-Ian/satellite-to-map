	<h2>A Deep Learning AI Created by Ian Moses</h2>
	<p>This AI was created as part of the coursework of <a href="https://cognizant.udemy.com/course/generative-adversarial-networks-gans-complete-guide">Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs): Complete Guide</a> on Udemy.</p>
	<p>The purpose of this AI is to take a satellite image (left) and generate a street view image (middle). The AI is capable of generating the image on the right. Three different examples are shown.</p>
	<img src="./1.png" width="30%" style="display:block"></img>
	<img src="2.png" width="30%" style="display:block"></img>
	<img src="3.png" width="30%" style="display:block"></img>
	<p>I think that this is the best I can reasonably expect. Some of the roads are impossible to see in the satellite image. And it's pretty difficult to tell the difference between a highway and a road based on the image alone. You need more information to really make that distinction.</p>
	<p>Personally, I think that the AI is better at identifying green patches than the actual map images are.</p>
	<p>The AI also struggles to interpret buildings and other objects. To be fair, the map views totally ignore a lot of that stuff, so the AI doesn't really have a great basis to learn from.</p>

			<li>Move to the area that you want, and zoom in to the resolution that looks about the same as in the images above.</li>
			<li>Use whatever screenshot tool you have to take a screenshot. Be aware that the AI will crop the image to 255 pixels by 255 pixels.</li>
